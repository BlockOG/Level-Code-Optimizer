Extract the zip file, then open the directory you extracted it to in cmd/terminal and type

```
python toolName.py
```

On some OSes it's `python3` so try that too

If you want to have colored text that I built into it then do

```
pip install termcolor
pip install colorama
```

And the goes to pip it may be `pip3` on some OSes

And if you want a GUI for the encoder tool you can do

```
pip install pysimplegui
```

##### All tools in here are made in python
